## Introduction
Foundry VTT module with the templates for the Memento Mori game in English and Italian for the Custom System Builder system ( https://foundryvtt.com/packages/custom-system-builder ).

To learn how to install and use it you can see the tutorial in the following link:

[![Video del tutorial](http://img.youtube.com/vi/OnefBmMfZno/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnefBmMfZno "Tutorial Foundry-Memento Mori")

## Installation
To install this module in Foundry you have to use the following Manifest in the modules menu as shown in the image: https://github.com/pedrobaringo/memento-mori-csb-enit/releases/latest/download/module.json

When you have created a world with the Custom System Builder system, you must activate this module. In the compendium tab you will have: "Actor_Templates".

It is important that when importing you keep the ID of the document as shown in the image:

## Create a PC
Once the templates are imported, we can create the Actors.

Click on Create Actor, give it a name and select the "character" type and a blank character sheet will be created.

![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/memento-mori-csb-enit/assets/148097688/147111f9-1053-49c4-9eec-3c1a427a1607)

Here we have two options when selecting the Template. If we want a landscape template in which the organs and virtues are in the same tab, we will choose "Drifter_Template_ENG (Landscape)" or "Drifter_Template_ITA (Landscape)". If we want it to be narrower and the virtues and bonds are in different tabs, we will choose "Drifter_Template_ENG" or "Drifter_Template_ITA".

Once we have selected the template and click on the refresh icon on the tab we are ready to start filling it.

At the top you can write the Dream (and the Mark if in Landscape) and tick the Name boxes. By ticking one of them, the option to add the Gift of the Name appears. This Gift allows you to make a roll as we will see later.

### Organs
In this section we have the 4 organs and the Blood, as well as the Stigma.

If we go to the bottom we can check the box "Edit Organ values?" so that a drop-down list appears under each Organ to select how many points it has. **Important: Sometimes if you don't check and uncheck this box once you have created the card, the rolls don't work**.

Once the values have been selected we can uncheck it to free up space on the sheet, we only needed it to create the Characters.

The Organ and Blood boxes can be ticked when corruption is present and will determine which dice are rolled for each. The dice rolls will be described later.

In the Stigma section we have the boxes for the 3 uses and a section to describe it.

### Bonds and Virtues
In these sections you can create your Bonds, with their Catchphrase,s and the Virtues, as well as write down the equipment you carry.

![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/memento-mori-csb-enit/assets/148097688/7d32c026-8210-4ed1-8fbb-21d03e95b145)

Boxes can be corrupted which will cause the Virtue Gifts and Bonds sections to appear. They will also cross out the Bonds or Virtues associated with that corruption.

In the gifts we can add a description and, as we will see later, we can make rolls.

### Notes
In the last section you can make notes about your character or write down your character's background.

## Create an NPC or Enemy
Click on Create Actor, give it a name and select the "character" type and a blank character sheet will be created.

![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/memento-mori-csb-enit/assets/148097688/2ec10313-c953-44b1-84ad-08118e3bedb7)

Here we have to select in Template the one called PNJ_Template_ENG or PNJ_Template_ITA.

Once we have selected the template and click on the refresh icon in the tab we are ready to start filling it.

![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/memento-mori-csb-enit/assets/148097688/7b229616-7729-42ea-80bc-ae4251a041f0)

At the top you can put the difficulty and the current and maximum hit points.

Underneath we have sections for any special rules it may have and a description.

## To make a roll
To make the rolls it is only necessary to click on the name or image of the Organ or the "Gift of...".

In the case of Organs we will get a dialog where we can modify the success threshold and we can check if we use the Name or some Bond or Virtue for this roll (You are allowed to select all 3 things, but by the rules you should only be able to do one of the 3 things).

![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/memento-mori-csb-enit/assets/148097688/3e4be380-901a-4499-97e9-efd8a97c118e)

In the case of Gifts we will get a dialogue where we can modify the success threshold and select which Organ we are going to use.

![image](https://github.com/pedrobaringo/memento-mori-csb-enit/assets/148097688/671a3ba0-08ec-4c51-ba26-8221ffc382c0)

Clicking on the accept icon will roll the dice and the result will be displayed in the chat, indicating the number of Successes and whether any Blood Corruption has occurred.

Alternatively, I have added the option to click on the Organ or Gift while holding down the Shift key to bring up a dialogue where you can select the Difficulty Threshold and the number of dice of each colour (defaulting to the dice that would be rolled if using the organ).
